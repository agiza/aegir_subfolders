'Subfolder' support for Aegir.

This is really ugly, but it works and doesn't require any use of mod_proxy that would otherwise
double-up requests.

You must give your site a ServerAlias consistent with the multisite/subfolder instructions 
for Drupal (e.g for example.com/foobar, add an alias of example.com.foobar)

The site name itself can be anything.

Also depends on commenting out this line in /var/aegir/config/server_master/apache.conf:

<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName default
  #  Redirect 404 /
</VirtualHost>

..unless of course you have defined a ServerName vhost for the common 'example.com' elsewhere.
